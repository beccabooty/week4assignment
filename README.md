Required
🎯 What requirements did you achieve?

- I achieved all of the core requirements again! I definitely will need more research on this weeks' topics as I feel I am replicating the processes/code without fully understanding. I fully understand the basics, what I want the code to do and the web response cycle but then when it comes to the actual code I don't 100% know how it works to complete its task.

🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

- I felt more confident this week after running through the code multiple times in workshops so I had a good jumping off point from the get go and could easily starting setting up all my code. The requirement for using media queries/dynamic styling was the biggest challenge as I undertook this with the most confidence and then found that after targeting my elements, my css selectors were not targeting anything. With no "middle-man" functions to assume need a debug, this was quite frustrating.

🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

- I still have issues debugging for myself. I can pretty confidently find what's broken and identify the element that is not functioning and I know to consolelog/postman for errors but getting any understanding from my errors and then finding a solution when it's more specific for an mdn/w3 page still gets me lost. It feels like I am mising secret context that I should pick up behind the face value of the demo.
