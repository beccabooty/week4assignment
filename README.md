Required
ðŸŽ¯ What requirements did you achieve?

- I achieved all of the core requirements again! I definitely will need more research on this weeks' topics as I feel I am replicating the processes/code without fully understanding but I'm really happy to be slowly chipping away at assignments rather than stuck frozen at the beginning. I fully understand the basics, what I want the code to do and the web response cycle but then when it comes to the actual code I don't 100% know "how" it works to complete its task.

ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

- I felt more confident this week after running through the code multiple times in workshops so I had a good jumping off point from the get go and could easily start setting up all my code. However, I think I found all the requirements challenging but I had the most sticking points with POST/GET routes, my CSS selectors, and the media query.

ðŸŽ¯ If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

- I still have issues debugging for myself. I can pretty confidently find what's broken and identify the element that is not functioning and I know to consolelog/postman for errors but getting any understanding from my errors and then finding a solution when it's more specific than an mdn/w3 page still gets me lost. It feels like I am mising context that I should pick up behind the face value of the demo/code.

Other reflections:

Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.

What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?

What went really well and what could have gone better?
